# Kanji Lookup
Kanji Lookup is an extension that adds more links to the integrated dictionary on kanji.koohii.com to make it easier to externally check meanings and occurrences of certain Kanji.
There is currently only a version available for Firefox, however everyone is free to take my shoddy code and port it to Chromium, or just request me to do it some time.

# Installation
## Firefox Add-on Store
Simply install it from [the listing in the Firefox Add-on Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/kanji-lookup/).

## Manually
You can install the extension unpacked, but it will be removed after a restart. If you're using the Dev or Nightly build, you can go to about:config and set xpinstall.signatures.required to false and drop the .zip file into about:addons and it will stay installed.
